What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system. This means that a local clone of the project is a complete version control repository. These fully-functional local repositories make it is easy to work offline or remotely. Developers commit their work locally, and then sync their copy of the repository with the copy on the server. (

Here, at TransferGo we use GitHub (
) as an online repository storage.
How Git works?

Git is designed specifically to help developers collaborate on various projects. It is not a backup tool, is not designed to store data and/or media files.

To save changes user has to commit these changes. After commit Git saves changes (not a full copy). It is possible to look into previous commit changes and if needed to revert back. Developers are able to work on multiple changes simultaneously because of concept known as Branches.

Branches can be understood as a fork in a river (repository) where each fork has its own path and adds more streams (commits) along its way. Have in mind, that word fork in Git has other meaning than branch.

Later, downstream, these branches can be merged into master branch. Terms Downstream and Upstream are actually used when describing where changes are added along its development. Upstream means somewhere where code repository is stored in a centralized way. For example, when user clones (downloads) a repository, local repository can be considered downstream and repository stored in GitHub can be considered upstream (this GitHub repository is also called origin). This is more obvious when considering projects that depend on multiple repositories, like Chrome is a downstream repository to Chromium (it's open source version).

Data team currently is not using multiple repositories and down or upstream terms are not really relevant.
